# RESULTS
- We first created the Retirement Titles table which displays employees born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31, 1955 (they are defined as "retirement age" pee their job titles. Some employees showed up mulitple times in the table output but that's because they have had different titles throughout their tenure at Pewlett-Hackard.
